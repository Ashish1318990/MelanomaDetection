Melanoma Detection Assignment

In this assignment, We (Divya, Bipul & Ashish ) have built multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.

A CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.

1) General Information:

  Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. In this assignment, We (Ashish, Bipul & Divya) are building multiclass classification model using a  custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. The model can classify images  in malignant and benign oncological     diseases (Actinic keratosis,Basal cell carcinoma,Dermatofibroma,Melanoma,Nevus,Pigmented benig keratosis,Seborrheicbkeratosis,Squamous cell carcinoma,Vascular lesion)
    
 The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
 
 All images were classified according to the ISIC classification and all subsets were divided into an equal number of     images except for slightly predominant melanomas and moles.
    
2) Conclusions:

    Image augmentation got rid of overfitting
    Rectifying the class imbalance got rid of underfitting
